Outline:
An implementation of the bug hotspot prediction algorithm described 
in http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/12/bug-prediction-at-google.html
This implementation, written in python uses the github api 
to pull down a list of files changed for each commit to a project.
It then uses the algorithm described above to calculate a score
for each file. Higher scores are usually indicators of a bug hotspot.

TODO:
Have the program remove commits that add and remove files.
A more oranized display of data after running the program.
